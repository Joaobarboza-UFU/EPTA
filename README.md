# EPTA ( Joao Barboza Rodrigues )
 Program designed to recreate the trajectory of a rocket for the Propulsion and Aeronautical Technology Team and all the codes researched and developed during my trainee project.
 
# Algorithm ( trajectory reconstitution )

To achieve the program goal , first the data is treated and converted to the csv format, then , using the csv library , the data is processed into a dictionary ignoring the empty lines. After beeing stores in the dictionary the data is read and inserted into lists , wich enables the library mathplotlib to read it (Dictionary are used just to simplify the coding if another function needs to be added ). Finally , the matplolib library plots a 3d graph with the rocket trajectory and 2d graphs with a vision from each axes , it also plots a graph of accelleration , ground speed and verticle speed x time.
